👨🏻‍💻 I'm a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and a recent Master’s graduate from Case Western Reserve University.  
🔬 My research interests span AI for Science, Foundation Models for Time Series Analytics, Vision-Language Models, Multimodal Learning, Agentic AI, Medical AI, PINNs, GNNs, and Knowledge Representation & Reasoning. Here's my latest publication in [Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04938-5)!

# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions

I developed and published [FAIRLinked](https://pypi.org/project/FAIRLinked/), a Python package that converts tabular experimental data into ontology-aligned Linked Data, and contributed to [FAIRmaterials](https://pypi.org/project/FAIRmaterials/), enhancing semantic interoperability across scientific datasets.

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Selected Professional Experience

- **Machine Learning Engineer Intern**, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (Feb 2025 – Present)  
  Designed transformer-inspired encoders for road-feature–based synthetic velocity profiling; integrated PINNs, GNNs, and DTW to enhance energy-consumption projections in NREL’s Route Energy Prediction Model.

- **Graduate Research Assistant**, SDLE Research Center, Case Western Reserve University (Aug 2023 – Jan 2025)  
  Engineered a scalable JanusGraph–Cassandra knowledge graph; authored and published the FAIRLinked PyPI package for ontology-driven data ingestion; led development of an internal OntoPortal for centralized ontology management.

- **Data Science Intern**, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (May 2024 – Aug 2024)  
  Built Kuzu DB–powered query and visualization pipelines over 15 million nodes; automated CSV-to-ontology workflows (70% reduction in manual effort) culminating in a PyPI release; prototyped GNN-based error-bound estimation for mechatronic systems.

- **Backend Engineer Intern**, MRI Software (May 2023 – Aug 2023)  
  Rapidly mastered .NET Core to build standalone vendor-payment software; redesigned database schemas and batch-processing REST APIs, cutting client processing time by 30%.
