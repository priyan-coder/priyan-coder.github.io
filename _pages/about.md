👨🏻‍💻 I'm a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a recent Master’s graduate from Case Western Reserve University, and I hold a BE in Computer Engineering from the National University of Singapore (NUS).

🔬 My research interests span AI for Science, Foundation Models for Time Series Analytics and Multi-modal Learning. Here's my latest publication in [Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04938-5)!

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions

I developed and published [FAIRLinked](https://pypi.org/project/FAIRLinked/), a Python package that converts tabular experimental data into ontology-aligned Linked Data, and contributed to [FAIRmaterials](https://pypi.org/project/FAIRmaterials/), enhancing semantic interoperability across scientific datasets.

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Selected Professional Experience
